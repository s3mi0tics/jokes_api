Jokes API
To solidify what we've read about mongoose commands and express, lets create a new express project from scratch called "Jokes."








Create a project folder named "Jokes"

within "Jokes" create a modularized folder structure (server ==> controllers, routes, models, config, server.js)

initialize a package json file using npm

install express and mongoose

create a mongoose.config.js file and setup your mongoose.connect function

create a jokes.model.js, jokes.controller.js, and a jokes.routes.js in the applicable folders

in the jokes.model file create a JokeSchema and export the mongoose.model("joke", JokeSchema)

in the jokes.controller import your model from the models file

Export a function to get all jokes

Export a function to get a single joke

Export a function to create a joke

Export a function to update a joke

Export a function to delete a joke

in the jokes.routes file: import * from your controller file and add an express route for every route listed in the wireframe

In your server.js file: setup express, import your joke routes, and run your server

Use Postman to create new jokes and use the browser to view them

Use Postman to perform the POST DELETE and PUT operations and use the browser to GET them
